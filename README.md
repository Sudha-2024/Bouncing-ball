# Bouncing-ball

- This HTML document creates an animation of bouncing colored balls.

- It initializes three balls with random positions, velocities, and colors.

- Each ball is styled as a circle using CSS.

- The `create` function generates the balls and stores their properties in arrays.

- The `move` function updates each ball's position and handles boundary collisions.

- The animation runs smoothly using `requestAnimationFrame`, creating an engaging visual effect on the screen.
